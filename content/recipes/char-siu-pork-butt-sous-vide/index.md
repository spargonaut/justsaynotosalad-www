yield: 665
prepTime: 20 minutes
cookTime: 8 hours

ingredients:
- 1 32 oz. pork butt
- 1 gallon ziploc bag 
- 1/2 cup hoisin sauce
- 1/2 cup brandy (or rum or bourbon)
- 1/4 cup honey
- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons sesame oil
- 2 tablespoons hot sauce (choose yuor favorite, I use Sriracha)
- 1 2" peice of ginger
- 2 shallots
- 4 cloves of garlic garlic
- 1 tablespoon five spice powder
- 2 teaspoon red food coloring
- 1 to 1 1/2 cups of cooked rice (white brown, whatever your favorite is)
- Chopped or crushed peanuts
- 1 small green onion diced up

directions:
- Chop ginger shallots and garlic and set aside
- Combine all wet and dry ingredients into 1 gallon ziploc bag with pork butt
- Set up sous vide cooker for water temperature 140F
- Once water temperature reaches 140F, place bag with all ingredients in water for 8 hours cook time (optional: I cover the top of the pot with foil to prevent water from evaporating over the 8 hours cook time, if not you may have to add more water over the 8 hours of cooking).
- After 8 hours, take the bag out and carefully take the pork but out of the bag to set aside.
- Preheat your oven to 400F (you'll finish roasting and glazing the pork butt with the sauce your about to create)
- Pour all of the contents of the ziploc bag into a blender (or food processor) and blend until smooth
- Pour the blended contents of the bag into a hot pan (I use a 10" cast iron pan on a medium high heat). As the sauce slowely comes to a boil you may need to adjust the heat on the pan so it doesn't boil over as you stir the sauce. Continue stirring for the next 15 minutes until it reduces down to a thick sauce.  This will be your baisting liquid for the pork butt as it roast in the oven.
- Once your oven reaches 400F and your sauce is looking more like a thick BBQ sauce your ready to go into the oven.
- On a foil lined pan (becuase it's gonna get baked on and hard to clean up without the foil liner) place your pork butt on the pan and brush on the sauce you just made so that it's completly covered.
- Place the pan and sauced up pork butt in the oven for 7 minutes, after 7 minutes take it out and turn it over with tongs so you can apply another round of basting sauce. After basting, place pork butt back in oven for another 7 minutes. You want to get a nice coat of sauce all the way round so that it's just about carmelized and sticky. If you have any leftover sauce, KEEP IT, that stuff makes a great sauce for your rice bowl. 
- After second round of roasting, take out pan and let the pork rest for at least 10 minutes before slicing.
- Slice the pork butt into thin slices. I try and slice it as thin as possible so it can be used for other dishes later in the week (use it for sandwiches, add it to rice noodles, or toss it in some ramen noodles).  
- Add rice to bowl, next add the thinly slice pork and top with green onions and chopped peanuts.  If you want to kick up a notch, add some Sriracha or fish sauce (nouc mam). I sometimes add kim chi, julian cut carrot sticks to the rice bowl if I have it on hand.
