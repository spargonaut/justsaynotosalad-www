Some helpful commands:
start the hugo server: `hugo server -D`  
then point your browser to `localhost:1313`

create a new recipe: `hugo new --kind recipe-bundle recipes/<recipe_name>`  
where `<recipe_name>` is the name of the recipe.  make sure to not use any spaces in the name.  
Then you can edit the file `./recipes/<recipe_name>/index.md` to add your new recipe.
You can also just add an image to the directory `./recipes/<recipe_name` and they'll be placed automatically.
